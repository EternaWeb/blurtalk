# BlurSend.com ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡±
BlurSend is an open-source platform designed for anonymous expression and storytelling. It allows users to share their thoughts or dedicate messages to individuals they can't directly communicate with, fostering a space for emotional release and connection. Developed using PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the website features an infinite scrolling feed for exploring posts. A new feed-refreshing feature is being added to improve usability and enable access to the footer, addressing the limitation caused by the continuous stream of posts.



# Attention: this is for mobile acces only!
I have made this only for moblie users and its an platform made only in ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡± albanian language, you can still use it since im working on adding English too.
